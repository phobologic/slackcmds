## Summarize the problem

With what I have shared above, do not implement any fixes yet.  First share a summary of what you believe I am asking you, with a brief plan on how you plan to begin to investigate it.  Once done, wait for confirmation that your understanding is correct, and for further instructions.

## Make a plan and share it

Now that you have a good problem statement, please provide a high level plan for how you will implement the solution to the problem statement.  Do not implement the solution yet.  Once you have shared the plan, wait for further instructions.

## Execute the plan

Please implement the plan as shared.
