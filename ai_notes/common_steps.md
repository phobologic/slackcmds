## Summarize the problem

With what I have shared above, do not implement any fixes yet.  First share a summary of what you believe I am asking you, with a brief plan on how you plan to begin to investigate it.  Once done, wait for confirmation that your understanding is correct, and for further instructions.

## Make a plan and share it

Now that you have a good problem statement, please provide a high level plan for how you will implement the solution to the problem statement.  Do not implement the solution yet.  Once you have shared the plan, wait for further instructions.

## Execute the plan

Please implement the plan as shared.




# To Step Through the Plan one Phase at a time
Ok, lets move on to implementing Phase 4 of the plan in @overall_implementation.md .  For each step:

0. Validate that the step isn't already complete, if it is, skip the rest of these numbered instructions and share a summary of why you believe it is already complete.
1. Implement the required changes for the step.
2. Implement any testing for the step.
3. Run newly implemented steps for the test.
4. Update @server_demo.py  with the demo for this phase.

Before you begin, do you have any questions?  If not, go ahead and begin with the implementation.  Once you are complete, please pause and wait for further instructions.
